# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read through these Terms of Service. Just by popping in or using the Site, you're pretty much saying "Yep, I agree to these terms!"

## 1. Our Services in a Nutshell

So, what do we offer? 🤔 The Site provides users with awesome paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. Think blog posts, special resources, cool e-books, and lively community interaction. Just a heads-up: some of our primo content is exclusively for our subscribed members!

## 2. User Registration & Your Account

- Users, when you sign up, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set a password to create your account. Pretty standard stuff!
- Users are fully responsible for keeping their account secure and for all activities that happen under it. Seriously, **do not** transfer or share your account. It's a no-go! 🙅‍♀️
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** any user's account if they, you know, break these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services

- Subscription services are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see all the costs clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden fees, we promise! ✨
- All payments go through trusted third-party platforms (like Stripe and PayPal), so relax! The Site doesn't store any of your super-sensitive payment info. We got you.
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew**, so keep that in mind! Make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends if you don't want to continue.
- Our awesome **14-day refund policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of your purchase, no worries! You can request a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email listed at the end of these terms and tell us why you're seeking a refund. Heads up: each user gets only one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely forces our hand.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property

- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means you can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without getting our green light first. Don't be a copycat! 🚫
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access our content, strictly for personal learning and reading. It's for you, and only you!
- For any commercial use or if you're planning on quoting us extensively, please hit up the Site to get proper authorization. We're usually pretty friendly! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines

- **Absolutely prohibited**: Don't upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep it clean! 🚫
- **Also a big no-no**: Using technical means to bulk download, crawl, or crack our member content. That's just not cool.
- The Site has every right to remove any inappropriate content and will definitely **ban users who violate** these rules. Play nice, folks!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions

- We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or even terminate parts or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls sometimes! 🤷‍♀️
- The Site **won't be liable for compensation** if, for example, our content becomes temporarily inaccessible because of things like force majeure, server meltdowns, or issues with third-party services. We can't control everything, unfortunately! 😟

## 7. Disclaimer

- The information provided by the Site is purely for reference. Seriously, it **does not constitute** any professional advice whatsoever (like financial, legal, medical, or anything in between!). Just keep that in mind.
- The Site **won't be held responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might experience from using our content or services. Just a friendly heads-up!

## 8. Governing Law

- These Terms of Service are all about the laws of the State of California, USA, and will be interpreted based on them, totally ignoring those tricky conflict of law principles. Cali rules! 🌴
- Any disputes popping up from or related to these terms? First off, let's try to hash things out friendly-style through negotiation. If that doesn't work, you're agreeing to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. So, you know, legal stuff! 🧑‍⚖️
