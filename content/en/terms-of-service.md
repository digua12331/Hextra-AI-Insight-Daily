# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to herein as "this site" or "we"). Hey there! Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By hopping onto our site or using our services, you're pretty much saying "Yep, I agree" to these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
Our services are all about dishing out awesome paid subscription content and membership services to users, including but not limited to blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Some content is exclusively for subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   **Users** are required to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
*   **Users** are responsible for their account's security and all activities; transferring or sharing accounts is strictly **prohibited**. 🔒
*   **This site** reserves the right to suspend or terminate user accounts if you play outside the lines and violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** are processed through awesome third-party payment platforms (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) – so don't worry, this site does not store your payment information.
*   **Subscriptions** will automatically renew 🔄 unless you cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
*   **Our 14-day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-timer and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the email provided at the end of these terms, explaining your reason for the refund. Each user gets one shot at this. Beyond 14 days or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are usually **non-refundable** unless legally mandated. 💸

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** is copyrighted by this site (hubtoday) ©️ and may not be copied, reproduced, or used for commercial purposes without our say-so.
*   **Users** receive only non-exclusive, non-transferable access rights just for your personal learning and reading enjoyment. Cool?
*   **For commercial use or extensive citations**, please contact this site for authorization!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **Users** are seriously prohibited from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that is illegal, creepy, false, offensive, or infringes upon others' rights. 🚫
*   **Users** are prohibited from using technical means to mass download, crawl, or crack member-exclusive content, please!
*   **This site** reserves the right to yank any inappropriate content and might even **ban** users who break the rules.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services at any time, without a heads-up. Just a fair warning! 🚨
*   **This site** shall not be liable for compensation if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service interruptions.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **Information provided by this site** is for reference only, folks. It does **not** constitute any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff), so don't treat it as such. ⚠️
*   **This site** is not responsible for any direct or indirect losses you might incur from using its content or services.

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted according to California law, USA – no funny business with conflicting laws.
*   **Any disputes** arising from or related to these terms shall first be resolved through amicable negotiation; if negotiation fails, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in Santa Clara County, California. ⚖️🤝
