# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we")! Before diving into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're agreeing to and accepting these terms.

## 1. Service Overview
The Site hooks users up with paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog articles, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction. Just a heads-up: some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
- Users are responsible for their account's security and all activities. Transferring or sharing accounts is **strictly prohibited** – seriously, don't do it!
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms. Play fair, folks!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed monthly/annually, with all fees clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden surprises!
- All payments are processed via third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal 😉). The Site *never* stores your payment info, so your data is safe!
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. So, plan ahead if you're making changes!
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: Listen up, first-time subscribers! If you're not totally vibing with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email (find it at the end of these terms) explaining why you're not feeling it. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, payments are generally **non-refundable** unless the law *really* makes us. No worries, we're all about fairness!

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, repost, or use it for commercial purposes without getting our A-OK first. Let's keep it legit!
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. Think of it as your personal library pass!
- If you're eyeing commercial use or need to cite a ton, please reach out to the Site for authorization. We're usually pretty chill, just ask first! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Don't even think about** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Keep the good vibes going!
- Also, **absolutely no** bulk downloading, crawling, or cracking member content using any technical wizardry. That's just not cool. 🙅‍♀️
- Just a heads-up: The Site can remove inappropriate content and will **ban users** who break the rules. We mean business! 🚫

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- Heads up: We reserve the right to change, suspend, or totally stop parts or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. It's rare, but sometimes necessary!
- If content is temporarily unavailable due to things like force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service outages, the Site **won't be liable for compensation**. Sometimes things are just outta our hands! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The info you find on the Site is strictly for reference, folks! It **DOES NOT** count as any professional advice (think financial, legal, medical, etc.). Always double-check with a pro!
- For any direct or indirect losses you might experience from using the Site's content or services, the Site is **NOT responsible**. Use at your own risk, buddy!

## 8. Governing Law
These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA, without fussing over conflict of law principles. If any disputes pop up related to these terms, we'll first try to sort them out friendly-style. If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Let's keep it civil, folks! 🤝
