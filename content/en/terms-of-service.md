# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as “**the Site**” or “**we**” from here on out)! 🤝 Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially saying "Yup, I agree!" to these terms.

## 1. Services Overview
The Site offers users a sweet array of paid subscription content and member services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers! ✨

## 2. User Registration & Account
*   Users will need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
*   Your account security and all activities under it are your responsibility! 🔒 **Sharing or transferring your account is a big no-no.**
*   The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
*   All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe or PayPal). Don't worry, the Site doesn't store any of your payment info! Your privacy is key. 🔐
*   Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before the end of your current billing cycle.
*   **14-Day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our services, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and let us know why you're unhappy. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are **non-refundable**, unless required by law. Fair's fair! 😉

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without authorization. That's just not cool. 🙅‍♀️
*   Users only receive a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** this content for personal learning and reading.
*   If you need content for commercial use or extensive quoting, please reach out to the Site for authorization. Let's talk!

## 5. User Conduct
*   It's a big **no-no** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights.
*   Also, using technical means to mass download, scrape, or crack member-only content is **strictly prohibited**. Play fair!
*   The Site reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. We keep things tidy here. 🧹

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads-up!
*   The Site **will not be liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just go wrong, unfortunately.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical). Always consult a pro for that stuff! 🧠
*   The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses incurred by users from using the Site's content or services. Use at your own risk, folks!

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
*   Any disputes arising from or related to these terms should first be resolved through friendly negotiation between both parties. If negotiations hit a snag, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's try to be friends first, though! 🤝
