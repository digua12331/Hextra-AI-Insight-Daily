# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "**This Site**" or "**We**"). Please read these Terms of Service carefully before you dive into using This Site's awesome services. By simply accessing or using This Site, you're giving us a thumbs-up and agreeing to these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
This Site is where we hook users up with paid subscription content and super cool membership services. This includes, but totally isn't limited to, awesome blog posts, exclusive resources, handy e-books, and lively community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of the extra special content is only for our subscribed members!

## 2. User Registration and Accounts
*   **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
*   **Users**, it's on you to keep your accounts safe and sound, and you're responsible for everything that happens under your login. FYI, sharing or transferring accounts is a big no-no – strictly **prohibited**.
*   **This Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, This Site doesn't store your payment info.
*   **Subscriptions** will **auto-renew** unless you cancel before the end of your current billing cycle.
*   **Our 14-day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet for first-timers! If you're a new subscriber and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of your purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the very end of these terms and spill the beans on why it wasn't a perfect fit. Each user gets one shot at this awesome refund. After 14 days, or if you've subscribed before, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely, positively says otherwise.

## 4. Content Usage and Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** is **copyrighted by This Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission.
*   **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content for personal learning and reading.
*   **If you need to use our content for commercial purposes or extensive citation**, please reach out to This Site for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **Users** are strictly **prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that is illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights.
*   **It is also prohibited** to bulk download, scrape, or crack member-only content using technical means.
*   **This Site** reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**.

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
*   **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads up!
*   **This Site** will **not be liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The information provided by This Site** is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (e.g., financial, legal, medical, etc.).
*   **This Site** won't be on the hook for any direct or indirect losses you might face from using our content or services. Seriously, we're not responsible for those kinds of bumps in the road.

## 8. Governing Law
**These Terms of Service** are all about the laws of California, USA, and that's how we'll interpret them, no legal conflict weirdness. If any spats or disagreements pop up related to these terms, both sides agree to try and chat it out nicely first. If that doesn't work, you agree to let the courts in Santa Clara County, California, handle it. Fair enough, right?
