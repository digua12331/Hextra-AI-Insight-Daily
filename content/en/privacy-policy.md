## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
When you're diving into our Service, we might ask you to share some personal identifying info that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This personal identifying info could include, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? It's automatically collected whenever you use the Service.

Usage Data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (aka IP address), browser type, browser version, the specific pages you visit on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how long you chill on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you access the Service via a mobile device, we might automatically grab some info. This includes, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you're rocking, your mobile device's unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

Your browser might also send us info when you visit our Service or access it through a mobile device, and we might collect that too.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We use Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash away certain info. The tracking technologies we deploy include beacons, tags, and scripts, all designed to collect and track info, helping us level up and analyze our Service. The tech we use might include:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is just a small file tucked away on your device. You can tell your browser to straight-up refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But here's the kicker: if you don't take Cookies, some parts of our Service might not play nice. Unless you've fiddled with your browser settings to reject 'em, our Service might just use Cookies anyway.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might contain tiny electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company (for example) count users who've hit up those pages or opened an email, and they're used for other related website stats (like noting a section's popularity and checking system and server integrity).

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device even when you're offline, while Session Cookies get wiped out the moment you close your web browser.

We're using both Session and Persistent Cookies for the following reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are a big deal because they're essential for giving you the services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They help verify who you are and stop any shady, fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you're asking for can't be delivered, and we only use 'em to make sure you get those services.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are used to check if users have given their OK to the use of Cookies on the Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you're using the Website, like recalling your login deets or language preferences. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience, so you don't have to re-enter your preferences every single time you hit up the Website.

For more info on the Cookies we use and your options regarding them, feel free to swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### How Your Personal Data Gets Used
The Company might use your Personal Data for these purposes:

- **For other purposes**: We might use your info for other stuff too, like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promotional campaigns are, and generally evaluating and making our Service, products, marketing, and your experience even better.

### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll hang onto and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to comply with our legal obligations (like if we gotta keep your data to obey applicable laws), hash out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data usually sticks around for a shorter period, unless it's used to beef up the security of our Service or boost its functionality, or if we're legally bound to keep this data for a longer stretch.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means your info might get shuttled to and kept on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws might be a bit different from your jurisdiction's.

By giving a nod to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're consenting to this transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including robust security for your data and other personal info.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You have the right to delete your Personal Data or ask us to help you scrub the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you delete certain info about yourself right from within the Service.

You can update, modify, or delete your info anytime by logging into your Account (if you've got one) and heading to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also just hit us up to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any personal info you've given us.

But hey, please note: we might need to hang onto certain info if we've got a legal obligation or a legitimate basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or in response to valid requests from public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might drop your Personal Data, acting in good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
- Play by the legal rules.
- Shield and defend the Company's rights or property.
- Stop or investigate potential screw-ups related to the Service.
- Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public.
- Dodge legal liabilities.

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% bulletproof. While we hustle hard to use commercially acceptable ways to safeguard your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has given us Personal Data, please get in touch. If we figure out we've snagged Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as the legal basis for processing your info and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parents' permission before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get redirected to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit.

We've got zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll give you a heads-up about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

You're advised to regularly peek at this Privacy Policy for any tweaks. Changes to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page.
